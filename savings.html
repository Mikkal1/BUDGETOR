   <p>The 50/30/20 rule is a simple budgeting framework that suggests spending 50% of your after-tax income on needs, 30% on wants, and allocating at least 20% to savings and debt repayment. By keeping your savings in line with this rule, you can budget effectively without compromising your financial goals.</p>
